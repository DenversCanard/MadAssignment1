*** Note that there will be some time to tinker and get use to using github with android studio
*** Android studio has some in built git procedures. I am not too familiar with them.

Setting up git flow
1. In git directory, use command "git flow init"
2. Press enter until the messages disappear
3. If you are working on anything please use a feature branch.
4. To use a feature branch, use command "git flow feature start <name>". Use a name appropriate to your task.
   *** note for Christian and I, we may create a different branch to make working easier ***
5. Once you are finished with the branch (eg your major task), make sure all files are committed, pushed.
6. Use command "git flow feature finish" this will merge your branch to the branch above it in scope.
